    A multi-agent network for comprehensive research and content generation.

    Capabilities:
    - Conduct in-depth research on any topic
    - Extract key insights and learnings
    - Generate high-quality content (blog posts, articles, technical docs)
    - Refine and evaluate content quality
    - Compile structured reports with citations

    Use this network when you need to:
    - Research a topic and create content about it
    - Generate comprehensive reports with multiple sources
    - Iteratively improve content quality through evaluation
    - Extract patterns and insights from complex information

  // Specialized agents for different tasks

    research: researchAgent,
    learning: learningExtractionAgent,

/**
 * Example Usage:
 *
 * 1. Single Task Execution (Simple, one-off tasks)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const network = researchContentNetwork;
 *
 * // Simple research query
 * const result = await network.network('Research the latest developments in AI agent orchestration');
 *
 * // Stream the response
 * const stream = await network.network('Create a blog post about RAG security best practices');
 * for await (const chunk of stream) {
 *   console.log(chunk);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * 2. Complex Task Execution (Multi-step with reasoning)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Complex tasks are automatically broken down and executed by the most appropriate agents/workflows
 * const result = await network.network(`
 *   Research the top 3 AI agent frameworks. For each framework, analyze their
 *   architecture, key features, and use cases. Then synthesize this information
 *   into a comprehensive comparison report with recommendations.
 * `);
 * ```
 *
 * 3. Client-Side Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { MastraClient } from '@mastra/client-js';
 *
 * const client = new MastraClient();
 * const network = client.getAgent('research-content-network');
 *
 * // Generate response
 * const result = await network.network('What are the key considerations for RAG security?');
 *
 * // Stream response
 * const stream = await network.network('Create technical documentation for implementing RBAC in RAG');
 * for await (const chunk of stream) {
 *   console.log(chunk);
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Network Behavior:
 *
 * 1. Routing Decision:
 *    - The network's routing agent selects primitives based on descriptions
 *    - Better descriptions â†’ better routing decisions
 *    - Workflow input schemas help determine appropriate inputs
 *
 * 2. Task Decomposition:
 *    - Complex tasks are broken into individual sub-tasks
 *    - Each sub-task is executed by the most appropriate primitive
 *    - Task history is stored in memory for decision-making
 *
 * 3. Synthesis:
 *    - Can be handled by the routing agent automatically
 *    - Or forced to use specific agent by mentioning it in the task
 *    - Example: "Make sure to use the report agent for synthesis"
 *
 * 4. Overlapping Capabilities:
 *    - When multiple primitives can handle a task, most specific is selected
 *    - Workflow input schemas help determine the best match
 *    - Descriptive naming yields better results

/**
 * Key Differences from Workflows:
 *
 * Workflows:
 * - Linear or branched sequences of steps
 * - Deterministic execution flow
 * - You define the exact path
 *
 * Agent Networks:
 * - Non-deterministic LLM-based orchestration
 * - Dynamic multi-agent collaboration and routing
 * - Network decides the execution path
 *
 * Use Workflows when:
 * - You know the exact steps needed
 * - You need predictable, repeatable execution
 * - The process is well-defined
 *
 * Use Networks when:
 * - Task requires reasoning about which steps to take
 * - Input is unstructured or open-ended
 * - Multiple agents need to collaborate dynamically
 * - You want the system to figure out the approach
