# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for enhancing the Mastra Governed RAG application with a modern, responsive layout system including a top navigation bar, collapsible sidebar, footer, and theme switching functionality. The project currently has basic components (AuthPanel, ChatInterface, IndexingPanel, SecurityIndicator) but lacks a cohesive layout structure and modern UI patterns. This enhancement will create a professional, accessible, and responsive user interface using the existing shadcn/ui components and improved Tailwind CSS styling.
