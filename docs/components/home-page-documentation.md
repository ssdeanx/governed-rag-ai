# Home Page Documentation

Simple landing page composition for the root `/` route. Aggregates landing components (`InteractiveFeatures`, `NewsletterForm`, `CTA`) inside a centered container.

## 1. Component Overview

- OVR-001: Compose landing UI sections to create the site's primary marketing/home page.

- OVR-002: Scope: layout-only composition of presentational components. Business logic and state are handled inside the composed components.

- OVR-003: Context: exported as the default page component for Next.js. Used as the app root page.

## 2. Architecture Section

- ARC-001: Design pattern: Composition — small presentational components are assembled to create the page.

- ARC-002: Dependencies: `InteractiveFeatures`, `NewsletterForm`, `CTA` from `components/landing/`.

- ARC-003: Interactions: No props. Internal components may manage their own local state or network interactions (e.g., newsletter submission).

## 3. Implementation Details

- IMP-001: The page uses utility classes to center content and limit width with `max-w-7xl`.
- IMP-002: Keep page light — avoid heavy client-only logic at top-level; delegate to child components.

## 4. Usage

This is a Next.js page component; no external usage needed. Edit the child components for content changes.

## 5. Reference Information

- REF-001: Child components to review for details:
  - `components/landing/InteractiveFeatures.tsx`
  - `components/landing/NewsletterForm.tsx`
  - `components/landing/CTA.tsx`
