# Demo Roles

This page demonstrates role-based access in the Mastra Governed RAG using sample queries against the corpus documents. Use the UI's AuthPanel or `scripts/make-jwt.js` to generate JWTs for testing.

## Role Examples

Roles are hierarchical (see [Security](./security.md)). Max classification and allowed tags determine access.

### 1. Public User (role: "public")

    - Answer: "All code must be peer-reviewed... Minimum 2 approvals for production code."
    - Citations: [{"docId": "engineering-handbook-001", "source": "Engineering Team Handbook"}]

## Testing in UI/CLI

1. **UI**:
    - Open <http://localhost:3000>.
    - AuthPanel: Select role, generate JWT, paste.
    - Chat: Ask query, see streaming answer + citations.

2. **CLI**:

    ```bash
    npm run cli query "JWT_FOR_FINANCE_VIEWER" "Expense policy?"
    ```

    - Logs: Answer + citations.

3. **Expected Behaviors**:
    - Unauthorized: Polite denial, no leakage.
