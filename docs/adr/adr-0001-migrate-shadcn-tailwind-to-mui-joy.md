# ADR-0001: Migrate Frontend from Shadcn/UI + Tailwind to MUI Joy

## Status

**Proposed** | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded | Deprecated

## Context

The current frontend implementation uses Shadcn/UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling. While this combination provides flexibility and customization, it has introduced several challenges:

- **Complex CSS Management**: The global.css file has become increasingly buggy with conflicting utility classes, fallback styles, and maintenance overhead
- **Bundle Size Growth**: Tailwind's utility-first approach leads to larger CSS bundles as more components are added
- **Inconsistent Theming**: Managing design tokens and theme consistency across components requires extensive custom CSS variables and overrides
- **Maintenance Burden**: Each component requires manual styling adjustments and Tailwind class management
- **Accessibility Concerns**: While Shadcn/UI provides good accessibility foundations, the custom styling layer can introduce regressions

The project requires a more maintainable, consistent, and performant UI solution that reduces CSS complexity while maintaining design flexibility.

## Decision

Migrate the frontend from Shadcn/UI + Tailwind CSS to MUI Joy UI as the primary component library and design system.

### Migration Approach

- Replace Shadcn/UI components with equivalent MUI Joy components
- Remove Tailwind CSS dependency and utility classes
- Adopt MUI Joy's built-in theming system
- Maintain existing design language while leveraging Joy's modern design tokens

## Consequences

### Positive

- **POS-001**: Simplified CSS architecture with reduced bundle size through component-based styling
- **POS-002**: Consistent design system with built-in theme management and design tokens
- **POS-003**: Improved maintainability with centralized component styling and reduced custom CSS
- **POS-004**: Better accessibility compliance through Joy's mature accessibility features
- **POS-005**: Enhanced developer experience with comprehensive component APIs and documentation
- **POS-006**: Future-proof architecture with active MUI ecosystem and regular updates

### Negative

- **NEG-001**: Migration effort required to replace existing components and remove Tailwind dependencies
- **NEG-002**: Learning curve for developers familiar with utility-first CSS approach
- **NEG-003**: Potential breaking changes in component APIs and styling patterns
- **NEG-004**: Temporary increase in bundle size during transition period
- **NEG-005**: Need to adapt existing custom components to Joy's design system

## Alternatives Considered

### Continue with Shadcn/UI + Tailwind

- **ALT-001**: **Description**: Maintain current stack with targeted fixes to global.css and CSS optimization
- **ALT-002**: **Rejection Reason**: Doesn't address fundamental issues with CSS complexity and maintenance burden

### Migrate to Traditional MUI (Material-UI)

- **ALT-003**: **Description**: Replace with full Material Design implementation using MUI Core
- **ALT-004**: **Rejection Reason**: Material Design may not align with current design language; Joy UI provides more modern, flexible approach

### Custom Component Library

- **ALT-005**: **Description**: Build custom component library without external dependencies
- **ALT-006**: **Rejection Reason**: High development cost and maintenance burden; misses benefits of mature component ecosystem

### Mantine UI

- **ALT-007**: **Description**: Alternative modern React component library with built-in theming
- **ALT-008**: **Rejection Reason**: Smaller ecosystem and community compared to MUI; less comprehensive component coverage

## Implementation Notes

- **IMP-001**: Create component mapping document identifying Shadcn/UI to Joy UI equivalents
- **IMP-002**: Establish phased migration plan starting with leaf components
- **IMP-003**: Implement Joy UI theme configuration to match existing design system
- **IMP-004**: Update build configuration to remove Tailwind CSS processing
- **IMP-005**: Conduct accessibility audit post-migration to ensure compliance
- **IMP-006**: Provide developer training on Joy UI patterns and APIs
