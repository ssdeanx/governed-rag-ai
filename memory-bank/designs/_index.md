    - Error responses

## Deprecated Designs

No deprecated designs currently.

## Design Document Naming Convention

Design files should follow this pattern:

```
[DESIGN###]-descriptive-name.md
```

Examples:

- `[DESIGN001]-security-pipeline.md`
- `[DESIGN002]-rbac-system.md`
- `[DESIGN003]-agent-architecture.md`

## Design Template

When creating a new design document, use this structure:

```markdown
# [DESIGN###] - [Design Name]

**Status:** [Draft/In Review/Approved/Implemented]
**Added:** [Date], [Time]
**Updated:** [Date Last Updated]
**Priority:** [Low/Medium/High]

## Adding a New Design

To add a new design:

1. Create a new file: `designs/[DESIGN###]-name.md`
2. Use the template above
3. Add an entry to this index under "Draft Designs"
4. Link to related requirements and tasks
5. Update status as design progresses

## Design Review Process

1. **Draft**: Author creates initial design
2. **In Review**: Team reviews and provides feedback
3. **Approved**: Design approved by stakeholders
4. **Implemented**: Code implementation complete
5. **Verified**: Implementation validated against design

## Next Actions

1. **Backfill Existing Designs**: Document implemented features as design specs
2. **Start with High Priority**: Focus on security pipeline and RBAC system
3. **Link to Requirements**: Create requirement docs that reference designs
4. **Maintain Traceability**: Keep cross-references updated
