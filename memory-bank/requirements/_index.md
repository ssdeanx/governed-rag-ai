# Requirements Index

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-30

This index tracks all requirement specifications in the system. Requirements translate design specifications into clear, testable criteria using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format.

## Status Legend

- **Proposed**: Requirement identified, needs approval
- **Approved**: Requirement approved, ready for development
- **In Development**: Implementation in progress
- **Implemented**: Code complete, needs verification
- **Verified**: Requirement fully validated and met

## Active Requirements

No requirements have been created yet. As requirements are added, they will appear here organized by status and priority.

## Critical Priority Requirements

No critical requirements currently.

## High Priority Requirements

No high priority requirements currently.

## Medium Priority Requirements

No medium priority requirements currently.

## Low Priority Requirements

No low priority requirements currently.

## Implemented Features Needing Requirements

The following features are implemented but need formal requirement specifications:

### Security Requirements

1. **JWT Authentication**
   - User authentication via JWT tokens
   - Role claim extraction and validation
   - Token expiration enforcement

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Hierarchical role system
   - Access inheritance
   - Permission validation

3. **Document Classification**
   - Three-level classification (public, internal, confidential)
   - Metadata tagging
   - Access filtering

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Security event logging
   - Access decision tracking
   - Compliance reporting

### Functional Requirements

5. **Document Retrieval**
   - Vector search with semantic matching
   - Security-aware filtering
   - Relevance ranking

6. **Answer Generation**
   - AI-powered response generation
   - Source citation
   - Streaming responses

7. **Document Indexing**
   - Batch document processing
   - Embedding generation
   - Metadata extraction

### Non-Functional Requirements

8. **Performance**
   - Response time targets
   - Concurrent user support
   - Scalability limits

9. **Reliability**
   - Error handling
   - Fault tolerance
   - Recovery mechanisms

10. **Usability**
    - User interface design
    - Developer experience
    - Documentation quality

## EARS Format Examples

Requirements should follow EARS patterns:

**Ubiquitous**: `THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]`

Example: THE SYSTEM SHALL validate JWT tokens on every API request.

**Event-driven**: `WHEN [trigger] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]`

Example: WHEN a user submits a query, THE SYSTEM SHALL validate their role claims.

**State-driven**: `WHILE [state] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]`

Example: WHILE processing a query, THE SYSTEM SHALL apply role-based access filters.

**Unwanted behavior**: `IF [condition] THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [response]`

Example: IF a JWT token is invalid, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 401 error.

**Optional**: `WHERE [feature] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]`

Example: WHERE step-up authentication is enabled, THE SYSTEM SHALL prompt for additional credentials.

## Requirement Document Naming Convention

Requirement files should follow this pattern:

```
[REQ###]-descriptive-name.md
```

Examples:

- `[REQ001]-jwt-authentication.md`
- `[REQ002]-rbac-validation.md`
- `[REQ003]-document-classification.md`

## Requirement Template

When creating a new requirement document, use this structure:

```markdown
# [REQ###] - [Requirement Name]

**Status:** [Proposed/Approved/In Development/Implemented/Verified]
**Added:** [Date], [Time]
**Updated:** [Date Last Updated]
**Priority:** [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
**Type:** [Functional/Non-Functional/Technical/Business]
**Completion Percentage:** [0-100%]
**Related Designs:** [DESIGN001, DESIGN002]
**Related Tasks:** [TASK001, TASK002]

## User Story

**As a** [user type], **I want** [goal] **so that** [benefit]

## Requirement Statement

[Clear, testable requirement using EARS format]

## Acceptance Criteria

**Crit-001**

1. [Criterion 1]
2. [Criterion 2]
3. [Criterion 3]
4. [Criterion 4]
5. [Criterion 5]

## Business Value

[Why this requirement matters]

## Technical Constraints

[Technical limitations or requirements]

## Dependencies

[Other requirements or external dependencies]

## Validation Approach

[How to verify requirement is met]

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** [Status] - [Percentage]

### Validation Steps

| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1.1 | [Step] | [Status] | [Date], [Time] | [Notes] |

## Requirement Log

### [Date] [Time]

- [Progress updates]
```

## Adding a New Requirement

To add a new requirement:

1. Create a new file: `requirements/[REQ###]-name.md`
2. Use the template above
3. Add an entry to this index under appropriate priority
4. Link to related designs and tasks
5. Update status as requirement progresses

## Requirement Review Process

1. **Proposed**: Stakeholder proposes requirement
2. **Approved**: Team approves and prioritizes
3. **In Development**: Implementation begins
4. **Implemented**: Code complete, testing in progress
5. **Verified**: Validation complete, requirement met

## Traceability Matrix

| Requirement | Design | Task | Status |
|-------------|--------|------|--------|
| _None yet_ | - | - | - |

This matrix will track relationships between requirements, designs, and tasks as they are created.

## Next Actions

1. **Document Security Requirements**: Start with authentication and RBAC
2. **Use EARS Format**: Follow standard patterns for clarity
3. **Link to Designs**: Reference design documents that specify implementation
4. **Create Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear, testable criteria
5. **Establish Validation**: Define how to verify each requirement
