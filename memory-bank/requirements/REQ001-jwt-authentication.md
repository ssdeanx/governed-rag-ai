# [REQ001] - JWT Authentication

**Status:** Proposed
**Added:** 2025-10-06
**Updated:** 2025-10-06
**Priority:** High
**Type:** Security / Functional
**Completion Percentage:** 0

## User Story

**As a** developer, **I want** the system to validate JWT tokens on every API request **so that** only authorized users can access protected resources.

## Requirement Statement

THE SYSTEM SHALL validate JWT tokens on every API request, extract role claims, and enforce token expiration.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Crit-001**

1. When a request arrives with a JWT in the body, THE SYSTEM SHALL verify the token signature using `JWT_SECRET`.

2. WHEN the token is valid, THE SYSTEM SHALL extract role claims and attach them to the request context.

3. IF the token is expired, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized error with a clear error code.

4. WHEN token verification fails for any reason, THE SYSTEM SHALL log the event and return a 401 Unauthorized response.

5. THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a developer script for generating demo JWTs for `finance`, `hr`, and `admin` roles.

## Business Value

Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive documents and enforces auditability of security events.

## Technical Constraints

- Use `lib/actions/auth.ts` for demo JWT generation patterns
- `JWT_SECRET` must be present in server environment variables (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)
- Use Zod schemas for request validation

## Dependencies

- Design: RBAC system design (to be created)
- Tasks: Implement middleware in API routes, update docs

## Validation Approach

Unit tests for token verification behavior and integration tests for protected endpoints.
