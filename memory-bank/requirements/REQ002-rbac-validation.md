# [REQ002] - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Validation

**Status:** Proposed
**Added:** 2025-10-06
**Updated:** 2025-10-06
**Priority:** High
**Type:** Security / Functional
**Completion Percentage:** 0

## User Story

**As a** compliance officer, **I want** role-based access filtering to be enforced at the vector-query layer **so that** users only retrieve documents they are authorized to see.

## Requirement Statement

THE SYSTEM SHALL apply hierarchical role-based access control filters to all vector database queries and enforce inheritance rules between roles.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Crit-001**

1. WHEN a query is executed, THE SYSTEM SHALL apply pre-filters to the vector query based on the user's role claims.
2. THE SYSTEM SHALL support role inheritance (e.g., admin inherits dept_admin privileges).
3. IF no role claim is present, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL treat the user as `public` with minimal access.
4. THE SYSTEM SHALL log access-filter decisions for audit purposes.
5. THE SYSTEM SHALL include unit and integration tests validating filter logic against sample documents with varying classification levels.

## Business Value

Ensures compliance, prevents data leakage, and provides auditable enforcement of access policies.

## Technical Constraints

- Access filters must be applied at Qdrant query time using metadata filters
- Role hierarchy defined numerically (admin=100 ... public=10)
- Use Zod schemas for any inputs related to access decisions

## Dependencies

- Design: Security Pipeline Architecture (documented as design)
- Tasks: Update retrieval tool to accept pre-filters, add tests

## Validation Approach

Test vector queries with sample documents and assert returned IDs respect access filters.
