# [TASK001] - Initialize Memory Bank

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-09-30, 14:00 EST  
**Updated:** 2025-09-30, 14:30 EST  
**Priority:** High  
**Challenge Level:** Medium  
**Completion Percentage:** 90%  
**Notes:** Foundation task for establishing AI continuity system

## Original Request

User requested: "create a new memory-bank following this" (referring to memory-bank.instructions.md)

## Thought Process

The memory-bank.instructions.md file provides a comprehensive framework for documentation that survives AI memory resets. The key insight is that AI agents must have a reliable, hierarchical documentation system to understand project context after each reset.

Key considerations:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Files build on each other (brief → context → designs → requirements → tasks)
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level, drill down as needed
3. **Spec-Driven Development**: Every task begins with clear specifications
4. **Traceability**: Link designs → requirements → tasks throughout

This initial implementation focuses on:

- Creating the complete directory structure
- Populating all core files with relevant project context
- Establishing templates for future documentation
- Setting up index files for tracking

The memory bank should capture not just what exists, but also provide context for why decisions were made and how to continue work.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create memory bank directory structure (designs/, requirements/, tasks/)
2. Create all core documentation files:
   - projectbrief.md (project purpose and scope)
   - productContext.md (user experience and personas)
   - systemPatterns.md (architecture and patterns)
   - techContext.md (technology stack and setup)
   - activeContext.md (current state tracking)
   - progress.md (what works, lessons learned, roadmap)
3. Create index files (_index.md) in each subdirectory
4. Create this task file to document the initialization work
5. Add guidance for next steps and backfilling documentation

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 90%
