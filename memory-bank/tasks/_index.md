# Tasks Index

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-30

This index tracks all tasks in the system. Tasks represent specific implementation work items linked to requirements and designs.

## Status Legend

- **Not Started**: Task created but work not begun
- **In Progress**: Active development
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependency or decision
- **Completed**: Work finished and verified
- **Abandoned**: Task cancelled or superseded

## In Progress
- [TASK001] Initialize Memory Bank System - Created core files and task tracking
- [TASK002] Correct Memory Bank with Accurate Project Information - Critical: Fix assumptions with real data from source code

**Progress:** 75%

**Next Steps:**

- Complete index files (this file)
- Add initial content guidance
- Document backfill process

## Pending Tasks

No pending tasks currently.

## Blocked Tasks

No blocked tasks currently.

## Completed Tasks

No completed tasks yet.

## Abandoned Tasks

No abandoned tasks currently.

## Task Naming Convention

Task files should follow this pattern:

```
[TASK###]-descriptive-name.md
```

Examples:

- `[TASK001]-initialize-memory-bank.md`
- `[TASK002]-implement-step-up-auth.md`
- `[TASK003]-optimize-vector-search.md`

## Task Template

When creating a new task document, use this structure:

```markdown
# [TASK###] - [Task Name]

**Status:** [Pending/In Progress/Completed/Abandoned/Blocked]
**Added:** [Date], [Time]
**Updated:** [Date Last Updated]
**Priority:** [Low/Medium/High]
**Challenge Level:** [Easy/Medium/Hard]
**Completion Percentage:** [0-100%]
**Notes:** [Any relevant notes or tags]

## Original Request

## Adding a New Task

To add a new task:

1. Create a new file: `tasks/[TASK###]-name.md`
2. Use the template above
3. Add entry to this index under appropriate status
4. Link to related requirements and designs
5. Update both subtask table AND progress log as work progresses

## Task Management Process

### Creating a Task

1. User requests work or issue identified
2. Document original request
3. Discuss and document thought process
4. Create implementation plan
5. Set initial status to "Pending"
6. Update this index

### Working on a Task

1. Change status to "In Progress"
2. Work on subtasks incrementally
3. Update subtask table with dates
4. Add progress log entries
5. Update completion percentage
6. Keep index file synchronized

### Completing a Task

1. Mark all subtasks complete
2. Add final progress log entry
3. Set completion percentage to 100%
4. Change status to "Completed"
5. Update this index
6. Link to any follow-up tasks

### Blocking a Task

1. Change status to "Blocked"
2. Document blocking reason in notes
3. Add progress log entry explaining block
4. Update this index
5. Create task for unblocking work if needed

## Task Status Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Not Started | 0 |
| In Progress | 1 |
| Blocked | 0 |
| Completed | 0 |
| Abandoned | 0 |
| **Total** | **1** |

## Task Priority Distribution

| Priority | Count |
|----------|-------|
| High | 1 |

| Low | 0 |
| **Total** | **1** |

## Upcoming Work

Based on `progress.md` and `activeContext.md`, the following tasks should be created next:

### High Priority

1. **Document Security Pipeline Design**
   - Create design document for multi-agent security pipeline
   - Link to security requirements
   - Capture architectural decisions

2. **Document RBAC System Design**

## Task Dependencies

No task dependencies yet. As tasks are created, dependency relationships will be tracked here.

## Traceability Matrix

| Task | Requirement | Design | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| TASK001 | - | - | In Progress |

This matrix will track relationships between tasks, requirements, and designs as more work is added.

## Quick Reference

**Add New Task**: `create task [description]`  
**Update Task**: `update task [TASK###]`  
**Show Tasks**: `show tasks [filter]`

Filters: `all`, `active`, `pending`, `completed`, `blocked`, `tag:name`, `priority:level`

## Next Actions

1. **Complete TASK001**: Finish memory bank initialization
2. **Create Design Tasks**: Document existing architecture
3. **Create Requirement Tasks**: Write formal requirements
4. **Prioritize Work**: Order tasks by business value
5. **Begin Implementation**: Start highest priority work
