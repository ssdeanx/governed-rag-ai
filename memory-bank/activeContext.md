## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Decision: API Bridge Layer Pattern (APPROVED)

**Context**: Next.js frontend needs to communicate with separate Mastra backend

**Decision**: Mandatory `lib/mastra-client.ts` bridge layer

**Status**: Implemented and Documented

**Rationale**:

- Clean separation between Next.js and Mastra processes
- Centralized JWT injection logic
- Environment-specific base URL configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Never import Mastra directly in Next.js

**Outcome**: Maintainable architecture with clear boundaries

**Next Action**: Continue enforcing pattern in all new API routes

### Decision: Custom Langfuse Exporter (APPROVED)

**Context**: Mastra's built-in Langfuse integration insufficient for our needs

**Decision**: Custom exporter in `ai-tracing.ts` (339 lines)

**Status**: Implemented and Operational

**Rationale**:

- Exports traces, spans, LLM generations, events
- Realtime mode for development visibility
- Graceful credential handling (disables if not configured)
- Maps Mastra AI tracing to Langfuse hierarchy

**Outcome**: Comprehensive AI observability across all agents

**Next Action**: Monitor in production, tune sampling strategy

### Decision: Multi-Agent Platform Scope (APPROVED)

**Context**: Project scope expanded beyond secure RAG

**Decision**: Position as multi-agent AI platform

**Status**: Documentation Updated

**Features**:

1. Secure RAG (6-agent pipeline)
2. Research workflows (multi-phase with suspend/resume)
3. Content generation (copywriter, editor, evaluation)
4. Product management (roadmap agent + Cedar OS future)
5. Public website (/, /blog, /docs, /about, /contact)

**Outcome**: Broader market appeal, more use cases

**Next Action**: Marketing materials reflect expanded scope

### Consideration: Cedar OS Integration Timeline

**Question**: When to integrate Cedar OS 3D UI?

**Options**:

- Immediate: Integrate alongside memory bank completion
- Short-term: Next sprint after validation complete
- Medium-term: After PostgreSQL migration and optimization

**Current Thinking**: Short-term (next sprint)

- Memory bank must be accurate first
- PostgreSQL can happen in parallel
- Cedar integration is high-priority user-facing feature

**Risks**:

- Complexity of bridging Cedar â†” Mastra
- Requires Cedar type definitions
- May uncover additional integration requirements

**Next Action**: Create Cedar integration design document

### Consideration: Testing Strategy Enhancement

**Question**: How to improve test coverage?

**Options**:

- Unit tests only (current)
- Add integration tests (workflow end-to-end)
- Add E2E tests (full user flows with Playwright)

**Current Thinking**: Prioritize integration tests

- Unit tests cover individual agents (good coverage)
- Integration tests validate workflows (gap)
- E2E tests for critical user flows (future)

**Next Action**: Add integration tests for security pipeline workflow

- Tool Architecture Design
- Service Layer Design

**Next Action**: Create initial design document structure

- `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and technical decisions
- `techContext.md`: Technology stack and setup

### Related Code

- `/src/mastra/agents/`: All agent implementations
- `/src/mastra/workflows/`: Orchestration workflows
- `/app/api/chat/`: Main RAG API endpoint

### Related Issues

- None yet (memory bank being initialized)

## Open Questions

1. **Agent Documentation Format**: Should agent design docs include full instruction text or reference code?

2. **Requirement Granularity**: One requirement per feature or multiple detailed requirements?

3. **Task Status Transitions**: Should we track "Blocked" status separately or as a note on "In Progress"?

4. **Cross-Reference Format**: Use file paths, IDs, or both for linking designs/requirements/tasks?

5. **Index File Updates**: Manual or automated updates to \_index.md files?

## Context for AI Agents

### Current Project State

- **Phase**: Production with ongoing enhancements
- **Stability**: Core features stable, documentation being formalized
- **Priority**: Establish memory bank system for better AI continuity
- **Blockers**: None currently

### Key Files to Review

When starting any new task, review these files in order:

1. `projectbrief.md` - Project goals and scope
2. `activeContext.md` - This file (current state)
3. `progress.md` - What works and what doesn't
4. `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture patterns
5. `techContext.md` - Technical setup
6. `tasks/_index.md` - Active work items

### Critical Patterns

- All agents must follow Kilocode contract pattern
- All workflows must have structured logging
- All API endpoints must validate JWT tokens
- All data must use Zod schema validation
- All requirements must use EARS format

### Current Codebase Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode enforced
- Agents in `src/mastra/agents/*.agent.ts`
- Workflows in `src/mastra/workflows/*.workflow.ts`
- Zod schemas in `src/mastra/schemas/*.ts`
- 4-space indentation, single quotes
- ES modules exclusively

## Notes for Future Sessions

### Session Handoff Information

**Last Session**: 2025-09-30 - Memory bank initialization

**Completed**:

- Created memory bank directory structure
- Populated all core documentation files
- Established hierarchical documentation pattern

**In Progress**:

- Creating remaining index files
- Documenting existing features as designs/requirements

**Not Started**:

- Backfilling design documents for agents
- Creating requirement documents for features
- Establishing task tracking for completed work

**Important Context**:

- This is the first memory bank initialization for the project
- Project already has working code; we're documenting retroactively
- Focus on establishing process, not rewriting code
- Memory bank will grow organically as new work begins

**Tips for Next Session**:

1. Start by reading this file (activeContext.md)
2. Review progress.md for current status
3. Check tasks/\_index.md for active work
4. Reference systemPatterns.md for architecture context
5. Always update both subtask table AND progress log

### Key Reminders

- Memory resets are expected - documentation is the continuity mechanism
- Update activeContext.md when focus areas change
- Keep progress.md current with lessons learned
- Maintain traceability: designs â†’ requirements â†’ tasks
- Use EARS format for all new requirements
