## Recent Completion: Mastra vNext Agent Networks Created 🎉

**Date:** 2025-10-04, 14:00 EST

**Achievement:** Successfully created two production-ready vNext agent networks with comprehensive documentation.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **research-content-network.ts Created** ✅
    - 220 lines of production-ready network code
    - 6 specialized agents: research, learning, copywriter, editor, evaluation, report
    - 3 workflows: research-workflow, generate-report, content-generation
    - Dynamic LLM-based routing for multi-agent collaboration
    - Memory-backed task history using createResearchMemory()
    - Model: google('gemini-2.0-flash-exp') for routing decisions

2. **governed-rag-network.ts Created** ✅
    - 250 lines with security-first design
    - 4 security agents: retrieve, rerank, answerer, verifier
    - 1 workflow: governed-rag-answer (6-stage secure pipeline)
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) integration
    - Document classification enforcement (public/internal/confidential)
    - Audit logging and compliance features

3. **Network Integration** ✅
    - Created networks/index.ts for clean barrel exports
    - Registered in src/mastra/index.ts vnext_networks config
    - Both networks accessible via mastra.vnext_getNetwork('network-id')
    - Zero TypeScript compilation errors

4. **Comprehensive Documentation** ✅
    - Created networks/AGENTS.md (335 lines)
    - Documented all three network methods: .generate(), .stream(), .loop()
    - Provided usage examples for both networks
    - Explained differences between workflows vs networks
    - Added best practices and troubleshooting guides
    - Updated root AGENTS.md with network entries

### Key Learning: NewAgentNetwork from '@mastra/core/network/vNext'

**Critical Pattern Discovered:**

- Import: `NewAgentNetwork` from '@mastra/core/network/vNext' (NOT from '@mastra/core')
- Required fields: id, name, instructions, model, agents, workflows, memory
- Model is REQUIRED for routing agent decisions
- Memory is REQUIRED for .loop() method (complex multi-step tasks)

**User Correction:**
Initial implementation used wrong import (`AgentNetwork` from '@mastra/core'). User correction: "no you must not got wrong info thats not how you use it... #mcp_mastra_mastraDocs" led to discovering correct vNext experimental patterns.

### Network Capabilities

**Three Execution Modes:**

1. `.generate(message, { runtimeContext })` - Single task execution
2. `.stream(message, { runtimeContext })` - Streaming single task
3. `.loop(message, { runtimeContext })` - Complex multi-step with memory

**Network vs Workflow Decision:**

- **Use Networks:** Unstructured input, need reasoning about approach, dynamic collaboration
- **Use Workflows:** Known steps, deterministic execution, predictable performance

### Patterns for Future Networks

**Network Configuration Template:**

```typescript
import { NewAgentNetwork } from '@mastra/core/network/vNext'
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google'
import { createResearchMemory } from '../config/libsql-storage'

export const myNetwork = new NewAgentNetwork({
    id: 'network-id',
    name: 'Network Name',
    instructions: 'Routing agent system prompt...',
    model: google('gemini-2.0-flash-exp'),
    agents: { agent1, agent2 },
    workflows: { workflow1: workflow1 },
    memory: createResearchMemory(),
})
```

**Registration Pattern:**

```typescript
export const mastra = new Mastra({
    vnext_networks: {
        'network-id': networkInstance,
    },
})
```

### Impact

- **Two Production Networks**: research-content and governed-rag ready for use
- **Non-deterministic Orchestration**: LLM-based routing enables flexible task handling
- **Memory-Backed Decisions**: Task history enables intelligent routing and completion detection
- **Security Integration**: governed-rag-network maintains RBAC and classification controls
- **Documentation Complete**: Full AGENTS.md with examples and best practices

## Previous Completion: VNext Migration Phase Complete 🎉

**Date:** 2025-10-03, 10:40 EST

**Achievement:** Successfully completed VNext migration for all workflows with comprehensive test coverage.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **chatWorkflow1.ts Migration** ✅
    - Migrated: `starterAgent.generate()` → `starterAgent.generateVNext()`
    - Added structuredOutput with ChatAgentResponseSchema
    - Fixed modelSettings structure: `{ temperature, maxOutputTokens: maxTokens }`
    - Returns: `{ content, object?: ActionSchema, usage }`
    - Zero compilation errors

2. **chatWorkflow.ts Verification** ✅
    - Verified already using `productRoadmapAgent.streamVNext()`
    - No changes needed - already on VNext
    - Confirmed with grep_search (no .stream( calls found)
    - Memory and streaming configuration correct

3. **Test Suite Creation** ✅
    - Created chatWorkflow1.test.ts (8 test cases, 223 lines)
    - Created chatWorkflow.test.ts (8 test cases, 208 lines)
    - Both test files using correct createRunAsync() + streamVNext() pattern
    - Test coverage: basic execution, temperature/maxTokens handling, systemPrompt, structured output, error handling

4. **Test Success Achievement** 🎉
    - **100% test success rate: 23/23 tests passing**
    - chatWorkflow.test.ts: 8/8 passing
    - chatWorkflow1.test.ts: 8/8 passing
    - contentGenerationWorkflow.test.ts: 7/7 passing
    - Test duration: 1.18s
    - Zero TypeScript compilation errors

### Patterns Learned

**Correct Workflow Test Pattern:**

```typescript
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync()
const stream = run.streamVNext({
    inputData: {
        prompt: 'test',
        temperature: 0.7,
        maxTokens: 150,
    },
})
const result = await stream.result
expect(result?.status).toBe('success')
const output = (result as any).result
expect(output.content).toBeDefined()
```

**VNext API Usage:**

- `agent.generateVNext()` - for structured generation
- `agent.streamVNext()` - for streaming responses
- Both use: `modelSettings: { temperature, maxOutputTokens }` (NOT maxTokens!)
- structuredOutput: `{ schema: ZodSchema }`

**Structured Output Mock Pattern:**

```typescript
mockResolvedValue({
    text: 'Response text',
    object: {
        content: 'Required content field',
        action: {
            /* optional action fields */
        },
    },
})
```

### Migration Status Summary

**All Workflows on VNext (7/7):**

1. ✅ governed-rag-answer.workflow.ts
2. ✅ governed-rag-index.workflow.ts (no agents - indexing only)
3. ✅ contentGenerationWorkflow.ts
4. ✅ researchWorkflow.ts
5. ✅ generateReportWorkflow.ts
6. ✅ chatWorkflow.ts
7. ✅ chatWorkflow1.ts

**Test Coverage (3/7):**

- ✅ contentGenerationWorkflow.ts - 7 tests passing
- ✅ chatWorkflow.ts - 8 tests passing
- ✅ chatWorkflow1.ts - 8 tests passing
- ⏸️ Other workflows - testing deferred (optional)

### Impact

- **Production Ready**: All workflows using VNext APIs, compatible with Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Quality Assurance**: 100% test success rate validates correct implementation
- **Documentation**: Test patterns documented for future workflow development
- **Template Available**: chatWorkflow.ts and chatWorkflow1.ts provide excellent test suite templates

### User Guidance Impact

User's iterative corrections were critical to success:

1. "must use vnext for both generate or stream" - clarified full scope
2. "all those tests are wrong always chec #get_errors" - prevented running broken tests
3. "thats not how you test. npx vitest run" - taught correct test command

This guidance led to discovering proper patterns and achieving 100% success.

- Migration scripts needed for data transition
- Connection pooling configuration required
- Status: Architecture in place, migration scripts needed
- Priority: High (production readiness)

## What's Planned

### Next Session Priority: Workflow Expansion 🚀

**Objective**: Create production-ready workflows for all agents, transforming demo implementations into professional, Cedar-integrated solutions

**Key Work Items**:

1. **Workflow Creation for Specialized Agents**
    - Content generation workflow (copywriter → editor → evaluation)
    - Professional RAG workflow (gov-rag question → answer with Cedar types)
    - Research workflow refinement (enhanced suspend/resume)
    - Report generation workflow (research → learning extraction → compilation)
    - Evaluation workflow (quality assessment pipeline)

2. **Workflow Template Expansion**
    - Build on chatWorkflow.ts (productRoadmapAgent example)
    - Build on chatWorkflow1.ts (starterAgent template)
    - Create reusable workflow patterns for agent orchestration
    - Ensure all workflows support streaming and error handling

3. **Cedar OS Type Integration**
    - Define Cedar types for workflow integration
    - Create type contracts between Cedar UI and Mastra workflows
    - Enable workflows to consume Cedar state
    - Bridge productRoadmap agent with Cedar components

4. **CLI and Type System**
    - Document src/cli/index.ts (corpus loading via CLI)
    - Document src/types.ts (Principal, AccessFilter, Document, Chunk)
    - Document src/index.ts (main exports)
    - Example tenant: "acme" for documentation

**Rationale**: Having comprehensive, well-designed workflows will allow professional implementation compared to blind exploration. The existing chatWorkflow examples provide excellent templates to expand upon.

### Cedar OS Integration 🎯

**What We Learned**: Agents that do one thing well are easier to debug and maintain

**Context**: Initially tried to combine retrieval and reranking in one agent

**Outcome**: Separated into distinct agents with clear contracts

**Benefit**: Easier testing, better observability, clearer audit trail

**Apply When**: Designing new agents or refactoring existing ones

**Lesson 2: Schema Validation Everywhere**

**What We Learned**: Runtime validation catches issues before they propagate

**Context**: Had bugs from unexpected data shapes between agents

**Outcome**: Implemented Zod schemas for all agent inputs/outputs

**Benefit**: Type safety + runtime validation = fewer production bugs

**Apply When**: Creating new agents, tools, or API endpoints

**Lesson 3: Structured Logging is Essential**

**What We Learned**: Consistent log format makes debugging 10x easier

**Context**: Early debugging was painful with inconsistent logs

**Outcome**: Implemented logStepStart/logStepEnd/logError pattern

**Benefit**: Clear execution trace, performance metrics, audit trail

**Apply When**: Every workflow step and agent execution

**Lesson 4: JWT in Body, Not Headers**

**What We Learned**: Sending JWT in request body avoids header size limits

**Context**: Large JWT tokens were getting truncated in headers

**Outcome**: Moved JWT to request body with clear documentation

**Benefit**: No size limits, clearer API design, better testability

**Apply When**: Designing authentication for new endpoints

**Lesson 5: Security Pipeline Stages**

**What We Learned**: Validating access at multiple stages catches edge cases

**Context**: Initial single-point validation missed some scenarios

**Audit Log Export**

- Audit logs stored in PinoLogger file transports
- No built-in UI for log viewing or export
- Compliance officers must access log files directly
- Planned: CSV/JSON export API endpoint
- Status: Planned enhancement

- Limitation: Cannot support multiple organizations in one instance
- Workaround: Deploy separate instances per tenant
- Status: Not in current scope
- Priority: Low (enterprise feature)

**Error Recovery**

- Some workflow failures don't have graceful fallbacks
- Generic error messages shown to users
- Detailed errors logged but not surfaced to UI
- Improving error UX and recovery flows
- Status: Ongoing improvement
- Priority: Medium

**Performance Optimization**

- Vector search can be slow with 10K+ documents
- Embedding generation bottleneck during bulk indexing
- No query result caching layer
- Current workaround: Limit corpus size, batch indexing
- Status: Monitoring, optimization planned
- Priority: Medium (affects scale)

## Lessons Learned

### Architecture Decisions 📚

**Lesson 1: API Bridge Layer is Critical**

Never import Mastra directly in Next.js API routes. The `lib/mastra-client.ts` bridge layer ensures:

- Clean separation between Next.js and Mastra processes
- Centralized JWT injection logic
- Environment-specific configuration
- Independent scaling of frontend and backend

**Outcome**: Maintainable architecture with clear boundaries

**Benefit**: Easier debugging, independent deployment, better testing

**Apply When**: Any multi-service architecture

**Lesson 2: Agent Single Responsibility**

**Insight 1: Qdrant Filtering Performance**

Pre-filtering with metadata before similarity search is 3-5x faster than post-filtering results. Always push security filters to the database level.

**Insight 2: Agent Memory Management**

LibSQL backend for agent memory works well for conversation context. Keep memory concise - large contexts slow down agent reasoning.

**Insight 3: Streaming Response UX**

Users perceive faster responses with streaming even if total time is the same. Implement streaming for any long-running AI generation.

**Insight 4: Zod Schema Reuse**

Share schemas between frontend and backend for type consistency. Single source of truth prevents drift and reduces bugs.

**Insight 5: Development Server Split**

Running Next.js and Mastra backend separately during development allows independent restart and better debugging of each layer.

## Best Practices

### Code Organization 📂

- ✅ Use structured instructions (role/persona/process)
- ✅ Single tool call per agent execution
- ✅ Clear input/output schemas
- ✅ Memory configuration when needed

**Workflow Design**

- ✅ Log every step (start/end/error)
- ✅ Use createStep with schemas
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Return structured outputs
- ✅ Document step dependencies

**Schema Definition**

- ✅ Colocate schemas in `src/mastra/schemas/`
- ✅ Export as named exports
- ✅ Use Zod's rich validation features
