# Project documentation writing guidelines

## General Guidelines

- Write clear and concise documentation.
- Use consistent terminology and style.
- Include code examples where applicable.

## Grammar

- Use present tense verbs (is, open) instead of past tense (was, opened).
- Write factual statements and direct commands. Avoid hypotheticals like "could" or "would".
- Use active voice where the subject performs the action.
- Write in second person (you) to speak directly to readers.
- Use simple sentence structures. Avoid complex or compound sentences.
- Use consistent punctuation and capitalization.
- Use proper spelling and grammar. Run a spell check if needed.

## Markdown Guidelines

- Use headings to organize content.
- Use bullet points for lists.
- Include links to related resources.
- Use code blocks for code snippets.
- Use images or diagrams to illustrate concepts.
- Use tables for structured data.
- Use blockquotes for important notes or warnings.
- Use horizontal rules to separate sections.
- Use consistent formatting for emphasis (bold, italics).
- Use definition lists for terms and their explanations.
- Use footnotes for additional information or citations.
- Use emojis sparingly to enhance readability or highlight important points.
- Use front matter for metadata (title, author, date).
- Use relative links for internal documentation references.
- Use absolute links for external references.
- Use `backticks` for inline code or file names.
- Use descriptive link text instead of generic phrases like "click here".
- Use proper indentation for nested lists and code blocks.
- Use comments for explanations or to temporarily disable content.
- Use a consistent naming convention for files and folders (e.g., kebab-case).
