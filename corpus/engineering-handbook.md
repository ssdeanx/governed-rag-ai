# Engineering Team Handbook

## Development Practices

### Code Review Process
All code must be peer-reviewed before merging to main branch:
- Minimum 2 approvals for production code
- 1 approval sufficient for documentation changes
- Security team review required for authentication/authorization changes
- Performance team review for database schema changes

### Git Workflow
We follow GitFlow with the following branches:
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: New features
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency production fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage minimum: 80%
- Integration tests required for all API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for features affecting >1000 users

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Next.js for SSR/SSG
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- Zustand for state management

### Backend
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express.js or Fastify
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- Redis for caching
- Elasticsearch for search

### Infrastructure
- AWS as primary cloud provider
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- DataDog for monitoring

## On-Call Rotation

### Schedule
- Weekly rotations starting Monday 9 AM
- Primary and secondary on-call engineers
- Compensation: $500/week for primary, $250/week for secondary

### Response Times
- P0 (Critical): 15 minutes
- P1 (High): 30 minutes
- P2 (Medium): 2 hours
- P3 (Low): Next business day

### Escalation Path
1. Primary on-call
2. Secondary on-call
3. Team lead
4. Engineering manager
5. VP of Engineering

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA
- Docker Desktop
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4. Run `docker-compose up` for local services
5. Run `npm run migrate` for database setup
6. Run `npm run dev` to start development server

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication
- Use OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- Implement MFA for all production access
- Rotate API keys quarterly
- Never commit secrets to version control

### Data Protection
- Encrypt PII at rest and in transit
- Use field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Implement audit logging for data access
- Follow GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements

## Performance Standards

### API Response Times
- p50: <100ms
- p95: <500ms
- p99: <1000ms

### Frontend Metrics
- Time to Interactive: <3s
- First Contentful Paint: <1s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1

### Availability
- Production SLA: 99.9% uptime
- Staging SLA: 99.5% uptime
