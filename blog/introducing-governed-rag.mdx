Welcome to the first official post on the Governed RAG project. This template was born from a simple tension:

> Enterprises want the creativity and acceleration of AI—but _must not_ leak sensitive knowledge or weaken compliance posture.

## Why Another RAG Template?

Most open RAG starters optimize for speed-to-demo. They skip (or hand-wave):

- Hierarchical role inheritance
- Document classification gates
- Multi-agent layered security
- Access-filtered vector retrieval
- End-to-end auditability

If you are building internal copilots, policy assistants, analytics explainers, or regulated LLM tooling—these are not optional extras. They are table stakes.

## Core Architecture Pillars

1. **Hierarchical RBAC** — `admin > dept_admin > dept_viewer > employee > public` with inheritance and claim reduction.
2. **Document Classification** — `public | internal | confidential` preserved through indexing → retrieval → answer synthesis.
3. **Security-Enforced Retrieval** — Access filters _applied at vector search time_ (not just post filtering).
4. **Multi-Agent Governance** — Identity → Policy → Retrieve → Rerank → Answer → Verify pipeline.
5. **Step-Up Authentication** — Confidential contexts can trigger elevated verification before answer continuation.
6. **Transparent Answers** — Citations + structured logs for every answer path.

## What’s in This Release?

- Production-aligned Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind v4 foundation
- MDX-driven Docs & Blog (you’re reading it!)
- Hardened landing & content pages with prefers-reduced-motion support
- Footer & navigation with accessible mobile sheet
- Blog pipeline: file system posts → metadata extraction → static compilation
- Custom frontmatter parser (no runtime dependency bloat)

## Example: Role-Constrained Vector Query (Conceptual)

```ts
const allowed = derivePermissions(userClaims)
const results = await vectorStore.query({
    embedding,
    filter: {
        classification: { $in: allowed.classifications },
        dept: { $in: allowed.departments },
    },
    topK: 12,
})
```

Enforce _before_ model context expansion—never after.

## Roadmap Snapshot

| Area          | Upcoming                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Observability | Langfuse spans for each agent stage              |
| Search        | Hybrid sparse+dense retrieval option             |
| Policies      | Cedar policy engine integration experiment       |
| UI            | Dark-mode adaptive syntax highlighting           |
| Evals         | Automated red-team prompts for leakage detection |

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Run `npm install && docker-compose up -d`
3. Index sample corpus: `npm run cli index`
4. Create a feature branch
5. Open a PR with clear security notes

## Closing

Secure AI augmentation is an _architecture problem_, not just a prompt problem. This project gives you the scaffolding to build responsibly from day zero.
